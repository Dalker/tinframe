### tinframe - a framework for TinTin++ using tmux

* This project is a framework for using the [TinTin++](http://tintin.sourceforge.net/) mud client using the [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) terminal multiplexer

* rationale: this framework provides a simple, stable environment for the "mud-hopper" who likes to "hop" from mud to mud, visiting various worlds. Each mud has its configuration stored in its own directory, where one can easily import pre-existing mud-specific scripts or create new ones.

* two layouts are provided, called by the shell scripts *tinframe* and *tinframe2*:
  * **tinframe** is meant for wider screens. In its main window the main pane receives mud output, with two lines reserved at the bottom for prompt information. On top of that a few lines with the same width are meant to receive copies of any chat lines (chat detection script to be configured per-mud based on a template). To the right, a fixed-width pane shows an automatic map (started with the 'newmap' alias), some logged information (connection/diconnection times, plus other information to be configured per-mud based on a template), and a third optional 'status' zone which may be configured mud-wise, e.g. to display some processed statistics information. A second tmux window is present in the background providing easy access to a terminal in the right directory for mud-specific scripting and/or note-taking (how to access it depends on local tmux keyboard configuration).
  * **tinframe2** is meant for smaller screens. The contents of tinframe's main tmux window are split between two tmux windows: the first one has the main mud output and chat zone, the second one has the map and everything else.
  * both of these scripts will look for the tinframe lib scripts at a location *../../lib* relative to the mud specific scripts, or at *$TFLIBDIR* if this environment variable exists; also, they assume mud-specific configuration is at *./muds*, unless *$TFMUDSDIR* variable environment exists

* login with **[F9]**, reload scripts with **[F5]**

* the character handler requires writing a small character file based on a template and specifying what the mud's log in screen expect if its anything else than "$user;$pass". Logging in with the 'loginas' alias will then ensure that the character's position on the map will be memorized between sessions, as well as any other information that can be optionally configured on a per-mud basis.

* the auto-mapper provides several aliases to help use TinTin++'s mapping capabilities:
  * **newmap**  *\<map\>*                      : create a new map and enter it
  * **loadmap** *\<map\> [room]*             : enter pre-existing map at some room (default: room 1)
  * **maptransition** *\<dir\> \<map\> [room]* : make moving to the room in \<dir\> direction actually switch to other map
  * **mapsymbol** *\<1 or 3 chars\>*           : adds a label to current room (or \<clear\> to clear)
  * **mapname** *\<name\>*                     : gives a name to current room (or \<clear\> to clear)
  * **mapexit** *\<dir\>* hide                 : hides/unhides map in the provided direction
  * **mapexit** *\<dir\>* void                 : makes room in provided direction void (or back to normal)
  * **mapexit** *\<dir\> \<action\>*             : really does \<action\> when moving into provided direction

  and also:
  * **savemap**   : saves current map file (done automatically when loading other map or quitting)
  * **closemap**  : manually closes current map (rarely useful)
  * **tossmap**   : leaves current map without saving (to discard changes since last save)
  * **redrawmap** : does what it says, if ever needed

  paths can be made and followed with:
  * **goto** *\<room\>* : creates tintin path to room
  * **[F1]**        : moves by one room in the path

  Finally, if keypad is used for motion (without numlock), then the numpad '**/**' key switches between two modes: moving for real (on mud) or moving on map (meaning on map only, not fo real). This is useful when adding map symbols and names, connecting rooms 'by hand', inserting void rooms, etc...

* Easiest way to install and try it:
  1.  cd on a console to some convenient place for installation and

      > git clone https://github.com/dalker/tinframe
  2.  make a copy of the blank mud template: starting at the installation root:

      > cd muds
      > cp -ri blank testmud
      > cd testmud

  3. edit the three mandatory lines on the main.tt file that define the mud's name, address and port
  4. rename and edit the chars/samplechar.tt file to define a character for that mud
  5. cd back to the main installation directory and run from a console

     > tinframe testmud
